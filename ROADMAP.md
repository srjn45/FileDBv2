# FileDBv2 — Project Roadmap & Status

## What This Is

A ground-up rebuild of [FileDB PHP](https://github.com/srjn45/FileDB-php) (a college-era flat-file JSON database) into a production-quality Go service. The goal is a **lightweight, embeddable, local-first database** that:

- Ships as a single binary with zero runtime dependencies
- Stores data as human-readable NDJSON files on disk
- Exposes a gRPC API (with REST gateway) over TCP and Unix socket
- Has a full CLI client with interactive REPL, one-shot commands, and batch scripting
- Auto-generates language-specific client SDKs from a `.proto` file

---

## Design Decisions (Why We Made These Choices)

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Go | Single static binary, goroutines for concurrency, fast compile, easy cross-compile |
| Storage format | Append-only NDJSON | Human readable, crash-safe (no in-place writes), sequential append = fastest disk op |
| Segments | Multiple files per collection, capped by size (default 4MB) | Bounds RAM usage, enables background compaction without blocking writes |
| Concurrency model | Pessimistic locking (`sync.RWMutex` per collection) | Write lock held for microseconds (just append + index update), so reader starvation never happens in practice |
| API protocol | gRPC primary + REST via grpc-gateway | gRPC gives persistent dual-channel connections (HTTP/2 multiplexed), bidirectional streaming, auto-generated SDKs; REST for curl/browser |
| Local transport | Unix domain socket | Bypasses TCP stack entirely for CLI on same machine |
| Compaction trigger | Dirty ratio (>30%) OR time interval (5min) | Dirty ratio prevents wasted space; timer catches slow-write collections |
| Auth | API key via gRPC metadata (`x-api-key`) | Simple, stateless, good enough for local/trusted-network use |

## Architecture in One Page

```
data/
└── users/                         ← one dir per collection
    ├── seg_000001.ndjson           ← sealed (immutable, old entries)
    ├── seg_000002.ndjson           ← sealed
    ├── seg_000003.ndjson           ← active (current append target)
    ├── index.json                  ← id → {segment, byte_offset} + SHA-256 checksum
    └── meta.json                   ← id counter, created_at

Each line in a segment:
{"id":1,"op":"insert","ts":"2026-03-29T10:00:00Z","data":{"name":"alice"}}
{"id":1,"op":"update","ts":"2026-03-29T11:00:00Z","data":{"name":"alice2"}}
{"id":2,"op":"delete","ts":"2026-03-29T12:00:00Z"}

Write path:  append line → update in-memory index → (rotate if size ≥ limit)
Read path:   index lookup → seek to offset → read one line
Compaction:  resolve latest per id → write clean segments → atomic swap → rebuild index
```

## What Is NOT Done ❌

### High Priority

#### 1. Language clients
The proto file is ready. All three clients just need `protoc`/`buf` generation + thin wrappers.

| Client | Package manager | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `clients/python/` | PyPI: `pip install filedbv2` | Not started |
| `clients/php/` | Packagist: `composer require srjn45/filedbv2` | Not started |
| `clients/js/` | npm: `npm install filedbv2` | Not started |

Each client needs:
1. Run `buf generate` with the target language plugin
2. Write a `FileDB` class wrapper with ergonomic method names
3. Handle connection setup (host, API key, Unix socket for Python/Node local use)
4. Write a README + publish to the package registry

### Medium Priority

#### 2. `golangci-lint` — stricter rules
`.golangci.yml` exists with `bodyclose`, `errorlint`, `copyloopvar`. Consider adding `staticcheck`, `govet`, `unused` once pb-generated code exclusions are tuned.

### Low Priority / Future

#### 3. Secondary indexes
Currently only `FindById` uses the index. `Find` does a full segment scan. A secondary index on a user-specified field would make filtered queries O(log n) instead of O(n).

**Design consideration:** secondary indexes need to be updated on every insert/update/delete AND rebuilt during compaction. Adds complexity — implement after transactions are solid.

#### 4. TLS support
Currently gRPC uses `insecure.NewCredentials()`. Add optional TLS via:
- `--tls-cert` and `--tls-key` flags on the server
- `--tls-ca` flag on the CLI for client verification

#### 5. Config file (`filedb.yaml`)
Currently all config comes from CLI flags or env vars. Add YAML config file support via `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` (already in `go.mod`).

#### 6. Metrics / observability
Add Prometheus metrics endpoint (`/metrics`) for:
- Records per collection
- Segment count
- Compaction frequency and duration
- Request latency histograms

## Key Files Reference

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [proto/filedb.proto](proto/filedb.proto) | Single source of truth for all APIs — edit here first |

| [internal/engine/compactor.go](internal/engine/compactor.go) | Background compaction goroutine |
| [internal/engine/index.go](internal/engine/index.go) | In-memory index, checksum, rebuild |
| [internal/engine/segment.go](internal/engine/segment.go) | NDJSON file I/O, crash recovery |
| [server/grpc.go](server/grpc.go) | gRPC handlers — proto → engine mapping |
| [cmd/filedb/main.go](cmd/filedb/main.go) | Server binary, startup, graceful shutdown |
| [cmd/filedb-cli/repl.go](cmd/filedb-cli/repl.go) | Interactive REPL |
| [cmd/filedb-cli/commands.go](cmd/filedb-cli/commands.go) | All CLI subcommands |
| [Makefile](Makefile) | All dev tasks |

## How to Pick This Up

```bash
cd FileDBv2

# Build
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Start server
make run          # serves on :5433 (gRPC), :8080 (REST), /tmp/filedb.sock

# Use CLI
make cli          # connects to local socket automatically
```

Next logical steps in order:
1. Language clients — unlocks the "use from any language" goal (Python, PHP, JS)
2. Secondary indexes — makes filtered queries O(log n) instead of O(n)
3. TLS support — hardens network transport
4. Metrics endpoint — adds Prometheus observability
